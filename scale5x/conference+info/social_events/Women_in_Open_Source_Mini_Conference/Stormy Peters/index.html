				<strong><em>Stormy Peters</em> - OpenLogic</strong><br />
				Founded and Managed<br />				<em><strong>Speaking Topic:</strong> "You're a Girl!?!" ... and Other Reactions Women Encounter in Open Source Software</em>
			</span>
			<p>Stormy Peters joins OpenLogic from Hewlett-Packard (HP) where she founded and managed the Open Source Program Office. As an early adopter of open source, Stormy was responsible for HP's open source strategy, policy and business practices. She was also a founding member of HP's Linux Division.</p><p>Stormy is a frequent keynote speaker on business aspects of open source software at major conferences such as the Open Source Business Conference and the O'Reilly conferences. She has addressed the United Nations, European Union and various U.S. state governments on open source software. Stormy is a co-founder of the non-profit GNOME Foundation, which is based on open source principles to encourage the development of a computing platform, comprised of free software, for use by the general public.</p><p>Stormy joined HP ten years ago as a software engineer in the Unix Development Lab after graduating from Rice University with a B.A. in Computer Science.<h3></h3>Why are less than 2% of open source software developers women ... and why do we care? We care because women are missing out on the opportunity to participate in great projects in a software development model that is changing the industry. In addition, open source projects are not benefiting from the value added by very talented women developers who could bring expertise, help grow projects more quickly, and help take projects in new directions to meet more user needs. With all these potential benefits, why aren't more women getting involved with open source? Is it due to a lack of role models? The response they get from the community? Lack of opportunity awareness? This session will explore solutions to the challenge of attracting more women into open source communities and ensuring the future impact of this valuable resource on community projects.</p><p>Are you interested in getting more women involved in open source software</p><span class="return"><a href="index.html">Listen Now!
