				<strong><em>Roger Klorese</em> - XenSource</strong><br />
				Senior Director, Product and Solutions Marketing<br />				<em><strong>Speaking Topic:</strong> Xen: The Open Source Industry Standard for Virtualization</em>
			</span>
			<p>Roger B.A. Klorese, Senior Director, Product and Solutions Marketing for XenSource Roger has driven product and marketing strategy for some of the most successful infrastructure software technologies of the past decade, including VMware ESX Server and VERITAS Volume Manager, and introduced and developed the application-aligned storage management solution space at VERITAS. He served as vice president of marketing at Trigence and Sychron, and in a variety of marketing, product management, and product support roles at Hewlett-Packard, Consera, Sendmail, MIPS, Celerity, and Prime Computer. He received his B.A. in Critical Studies (English/Film) and Computer Science from Dartmouth College.<h3></h3>Intel's recent announcement of the availability of a 4-core server processor is a dramatic acceleration of the multi-core future of x86 scale-out data centers. A dual socket server is suddenly an 8-way SMP machine with the horsepower of 8 single CPU servers of a year or so ago. Though multi-core offers tremendous opportunities, it poses tremendous challenges. The x86 server market has a huge legacy code base that needs to be preserved, and simply requiring applications to be re-written to be multi-threaded is not the answer. The only way to deliver the power of multi-core servers to customers, is through virtualization.</p><p>The Xen hypervisor has quickly become a standard adopted by many leading ISVs and OEMs to build comprehensive data center efficiency and management solutions. The Xen hypervisor is the highest performing virtualization platform available, and supports up to 64-way SMP servers today. It is collaboratively developed by a community comprised of developers from over 20 major enterprise infrastructure vendors, and leads the industry in feature sets for security and performance. By leveraging open source development, the Xen hypervisor is able to stay at the forefront of virtualization technology through contributions from partner vendors seeking better solutions for their customers, and the greater Xen community continually surfacing innovations to the market. This presentation will provide an update on the progress of the Xen hypervisor, including a tech dive on Xen's support for Windows on Intel VT and AMD-V CPUs, and its multi-core scheduler. We will discuss its march toward ubiquity, and the adoption of its paravirtualization architecture by every x86 OS Vendor for their next software release.
