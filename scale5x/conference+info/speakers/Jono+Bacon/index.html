				<strong><em>Jono Bacon</em> - Canonical</strong><br />
				Ubuntu Community Manager<br />				<em><strong>Speaking Topic:</strong> How to Herd Cats and Influence People</em>
			</span>
			<p>Jono Bacon works for Canonical as the Ubuntu Community Manager and works to optimise and improve the Ubuntu comminuty and and keep the troops happy. In addition to this, he is a lead developer on Jokosher (www.jokosher.org), the co-founder of LUGRadio (www.lugradio.org) and has founded and worked on a number of previous projects such as KDE, KDE::Enterprise, the Infopoint project, KDE Usability Study and more. He is an established public speaker, having spoken around the world about Open Source and free software and has three books published and over 400 articles to his name. He is also a prolific blogger and writes regularly at <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org" target="_blank">http://www.jonobacon.org</a>.<h3></h3>When talking about free software, the word 'community' comes trotting closely behind, and has become a Fully Buzzword Compliant (FBC) term. Although bandied around by those with and without whispy beards, there is often confusion and misunderstanding about how exactly community works and how we can improve our different communities. Clearly different people see community in different ways, but surely there must be an underlying structure common to all communities? Surely we can draw some parallels with different communities?</p><p>In this entertaining and anecdote driven talk, Jono Bacon takes a stroll through the meaning of community, how the free software community has developed from the early days, and how the business world have handled open communities in good and not-so-good ways. The presentation also delves successful communities in action, and the techniques involved in creating communities that are exciting, productive and fun to be part of. Finally, Jono will share some thoughts and experience of how the Ubuntu community works, where it is moving forward and what challenges lie ahead.</p><p>If you are curious about how to build better communities, or are just befuzzed about them, be sure to come along to this interesting and amusing presentation.
