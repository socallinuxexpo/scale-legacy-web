	Helix represents a platform, Helix DNA, and a community (
	for the standardization and expansion of
        digital media. The Helix DNA consists of source code for creation,
	delivery and playback of digital media developed by RealNetworks over
	the past nine years, as well as a set of interfaces for building
	media-enabled applications. Helix community members are able to use this
	source code to build media-capable products with industry-leading
	technology and commonly used interfaces. The Helix community offers
	source code of Helix DNA under commercial community and open source
	licenses. RealNetworks has also released a family of commercial products
	built on top of the Helix DNA platform, including the free RealOne
	Player for the desktop, Helix Producer Plus, and the Helix Universal
	Server.
