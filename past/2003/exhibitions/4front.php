	Open Sound System (OSS) is an audio architecture to support

	that provide a uniform API across all the major processor
	architectures and support popular off-the-shelf sound
	cards. Applications written to the OSS API are source code 
	compatible across all supported platforms. OSS is supported
	by a large number of open source as well as commercial
	audio applications for audio recording and playback,
	MIDI music synthesis, speech recognition and generation,
	video and DVD playback, video conferencing, VOIP,
	video games and Java audio applications.<br><br>
