	<a href="http://www.sgvlug.org">San Gabriel Valley LUG: CinePaint</a><br><br>
	SGVLUG will be demonstrating CinePaint, a free open source painting and 
	image retouching program.  CinePaint works best with 35mm film and other
	high resolution high dynamic range images. It is the most popular open 
	source tool in the motion picture industry -- used in 2 Fast 2 Furious,
	Scooby-Doo, Harry Potter, Stuart Little and other feature films. CinePaint
	is used for painting of background mattes and for frame-by-frame retouching
	of movies. The SGVLUG meets on the 2nd Thursday of each month in the 
	Guggenheim Building on the Caltech Campus.  Details can be found at
