	LinuxFund is a non-profit organization which seeks to advance the art
	of the Open Source by issuing development grants for projects which may
	not be suitable for commercial or volunteer efforts, but which will
	enhance the long-term vitality of the Open Source. All projects we fund
	will become Open Source. To be more clear, the projects that we aim to
	fund are the development and the documentation of Open Source.<br><br>
	
	LinuxFund raises a large part of its budget with the LinuxFund credit
	card by MBNA. If you do not have you LinuxFund card yet come our booth
	and sign up!<br><br>
