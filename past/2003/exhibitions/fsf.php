	What the FSF provides to computer users, above all, is the chance to
	use a computer in freedom--using free software. Since 1985 the FSF has
	sponsored the development of the free software operating system GNU .
	The GNU/Linux variant of GNU is already widely used. The GNU/Hurd
	system, based on our GNU Hurd kernel, is ready for wizards and
	enthusiasts to try.<br><br>
