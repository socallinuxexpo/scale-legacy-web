	Genesi is a new company that has deep roots in its 
	people who come from various segments of the computer 
	industry. Genesi has two core groups for operating system
	development and electronics engineering that have worked
	together to create an open hardware platform that provides
	exciting possibilities for many markets.<br><br>

	Genesi's new hardware platform is called Pegasos. The 
	IBM/Motorola PowerPC(tm) family of processors was 
	selected to drive the Pegasos system.  Genesi's 
	engineers created an open hardware platform based on the 
	CHRP motherboard standard for the PowerPC and selected
	Open Firmware so that many operating systems can work
	easily on the Pegasos platform.<br><br>

	To compliment the Pegasos and provide a complete solution,
	Genesi has developed MorphOS - a preemptive multitasking 
	operating system. MorphOS combines a modest footprint with 
	scalability, high performance, and amazin ease of use for 
	developers and end users. Its beautifully designed 
	interface and modular object-oriented design offers a 
	modern solution.<br><br>

	Genesi will display several machines running MorphOS 
	1.4 and different versions of Linux, including Debian Linux,
	a live bootable CD of Gentoo Linux, Mandrake 9, as well as 
	Mac on Linux.  In addition to standard applications, the 
	Pegasos machines will demonstrate its capability for With
	Full Screen DVD Playback DVD Ripping / DIVX encoding, 
	Streaming Internet Radio with file download and more...<br><br>

	Together Pegasos and MorphOS provide a singularly powerful
	solution for both personal and professional applications!
	The Pegasos and three of the available operating systems will
	bear the Ready for IBM logo.<br><br>
