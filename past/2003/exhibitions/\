	LinuxChixLA is the Los Angeles chapter of the LinuxChix  community.
	They are a community of women who both like Linux and desire a 
	environment where women support women in computing.  The membership ranges
	from novices to experienced users, and includes professional and amateur 
	programmers, web developers, system administrators, and technical writers.<br><br>
	
	LinuxChixLA will have a Jabber server and several clients, demonstrating
	how to setup either a public internet or private intranet Jabber server, 
	and the installation of Jabber compatible clients.<br><br>

	Jabber is an open source project which uses an open protocol based on XML
	for the real-time exchange of 	messages between any two points on the
	internet, aka Instant Messaging (IM). Other IM environments (MSN, AIM, and Yahoo!)
	have both proprietary server platforms and are moving to proprietary 
	clients. The advantages of Jabber over proprietary technology includes 
	openness, extensibility, and security. <br><br>
