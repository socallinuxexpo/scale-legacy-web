	the upcoming Southern California Linux Expo (SCALE) along with
	other Linux solutions providers such as IBM, Novell and Debian.
	This exciting Linux event will be occurring later this month on
	November, 22nd, 2003 at the LA Convention Center in Los Angeles, 
	CA. <br><br>

	You will find Genesi at booth #42 on the exhibitor's floor. 
	Representing Genesi are co-owners Raquel Velasco and Bill 
	Buck as well as Paul Adams and Thomas Morris of the Genesi 
	USA offices. They will be demonstrating the company's 
	all-new PowerPC hardware solution running several variants
	of Linux, including Debian, as well as OpenBSD and Genesi's 
	own MorphOS. <br><br> 

	MorphOS is a preemptive multitasking operating system that 
	combines a modest memory footprint with scalability, high 
	performance, and amazing ease of use for developers and 
	end users. Its beautifully designed interface and modular 
	object-oriented design offers a modern solution and is supplied
	with the Pegasos hardware.<br><br>
