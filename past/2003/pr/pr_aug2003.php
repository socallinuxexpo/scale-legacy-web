SoCal Linux Expo is calling all open source organizations to participate in this year's SoCal Linux Expo.<br><br>

The second annual SoCal Linux Expo is fast approaching! If your organization participated last year, you know what fun SCALE was. If they didn't, you missed a great opportunity to show off your group!<br><br>

SCALE 2X is November 22. SCALE 1X was so sucessful it was moved from the USC Davidson conference center to the Los Angeles Convention Center. With the increased number of expo booths there's going to be substantially more foot traffic through the expo floor. If you want your organization to be seen and noticed, this is the place to be.<br><br>

November 22nd may sound like a long ways off, but it's not. There's a lot to do between now and then:<br><br>

- Register your topic with Gareth Greenway (<a HREF="mailto:gareth=at=socallinuxexpo.org" CLASS="light">gareth=at=socallinuxexpo.org</a>) soon.<br><br>

- Designate a rep, and tell Gareth who that liaison is.<br><br>

- Show your stuff at SCALE2X - start planning!<br><br>
