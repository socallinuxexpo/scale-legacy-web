SCALE2X is Over! It was, by all measures, a complete success. The SCALE
committee had set a year over year growth of 25%, and we made that, with
25% more booths, all filled, and with 800 people passing through the
doors.<br><br>

The seminars were well-attended, there was continual foot traffic
through the aisles (especially during the break between talks), and the
energy level was high everywhere.<br><br>

Some comments by a few of the exhibitors:<br><br>

<hr NOSHADE>

We had a great time at SCALE. It was our first expo we've done and we
found SCALE convenient as we are an LA-based company and the caliber of
companies that exhibited at SCALE were top notch, so were the speakers.
So from that standpoint we were very happy.<br><br>

We hope to come back for SCALE 3 and if I may make a suggestion, that
would be to add some kind of visitor tracking on the badges, some kind
of card reader would enable exhibitors to do follow up marketing. We
understand that SCALE is not Linux Wold but I would like to see SCALE
become a premier Linux conference in So Cal.<br><br>

Best regards,<br><br>

Thanks for your nice message and for all your patience and flexibility
in getting Pearson signed on as an exhibitor. I enjoyed working with
you. Author/Speaker John Terpstra was very pleased with his experience
at the conference - I spoke with him earlier this week.<br><br>

Congratulations! And keep in touch.<br><br>

Please let me take this opportunity to let you know your group did an
excellent job of presenting the show. If you need a speaker on careers
in Linux, obtaining different Linux certification, or the information
technology market in general: we will be happy to provide you with
speakers for your next event. We look forward to working with you for
your next show in Los Angeles.<br><br>

Please give my thanks to the team for putting on another good show. I
hope I will make it out there for SCALE 3. Keep up the good work.<br><br>

I wanted to congratulate you on putting on the best SCALE conference
yet. You and your colleagues must be very proud and quite pleased with
the quality and the increase in overall attendance.<br><br>

From my perspective at our booth there was representation from all walks
of life, including business, newbies, advanced FOSS users, your average
"Joe", and even a few kids. I didn't see anyone from Government or
Educational areas, but then again I didn't talk to everyone :-)<br><br>

Such conferences are so important in that we have an opportunity to
exchange ideas and catch up with our friends in a very concentrated way
and SCALE really serves the purpose of pulling together the entire S.
Calif community for at least one day out of the year.<br><br>

Anyhow I could go on and on, but just wanted to thank you so much for
all of your groups creativity and hard work that made all of it
possible.<br><br>

Thanks.<br><br>

Just a quick note to say thanks for all the work you and the other SCALE
organizers put into SCALE. It was a remarkable event ... I really don't
have the words for how impressed I was with the overall organization and
quality of the presentations.<br><br>

Kudos, Kudos, Kudos. A job well done. I look forward to next year's
SCALE 3x :)<br><br>

Thanks again for organizing a most excellent event! We look forward to
the next one.<br><br>

We've already begun planning for S3X. The easiest way to keep up with
developments is to subscribe to the scale-announce mailing list. Stay
tuned!<br><br>
