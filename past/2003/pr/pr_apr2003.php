Mark your calendars! The Linux Expo of Southern California, a joint effort of USC, USCLUG, UCLALUG, and SCLUG, is proud to announce the second annual Southern California Linux Expo, scheduled for November 22nd, 2003 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The Southern California Linux Expo will again bring together Linux and Open Source Software companies, developers, and users.<br><br>

Last year's Expo was a tremendous success, with over 600 people attending. SCALE 2x will expand upon the success of SCALE 1x to promote Linux and the Open Source Software community in Southern California.<br><br>

<i>" .. this is one of the few good grass-root level technical conferences for Linux"<br><br>
