<a CLASS="light" HREF="http://www.socallinuxexpo.com/">The Linux Expo of Southern California</a>,
a joint effort of the USC, UCLA,
and Simi-Conejo Linux Users Groups, and the USC Computer Science
Department, is proud to announce that these speakers have been added to
the SCALE 2X lecture tracks:<br><br>

<a CLASS="light" HREF="/past/2003/speakers/speakers_mcquillan.php">Jim
McQuillan</a> - Jim has been developing solutions for customers,
utilizing Unix and networking since 1984 and has been involved with
Linux since 1995. Jim is the founder and project leader of the Linux
Terminal Server Project (LTSP).<br><br>

Jim's will discuss the Linux Terminal Server Project.<br><br>

<a CLASS="light" HREF="http://www.ltsp.org/">The Linux Terminal Server Project</a>
(http://www.LTSP.org) is an open
source project whose focus is to provide everything you need to run thin
client computers in a GNU/Linux environment. It has received worldwide
recognition as the standard method of deploying thin clients in a
GNU/Linux environment.<br><br>

<a CLASS="light" HREF="http://www.socallinuxexpo.com/speakers/speakers_rowe.php">Robin Rowe</a> - Robin Rowe is the founder of the
<a CLASS="light" HREF="http://www.linuxmovies.org/">Linux Movies Group</a>
(www.linuxmovies.org) and the project leader of
<a CLASS="light" HREF="http://www.cinepaint.org/">CinePaint</a>
(www.cinepaint.org). He has written about Linux motion picture
technology for Linux Journal, Computer Graphics World, and Millimeter.<br><br>

Robin will discuss "Linux Movies and CinePaint"<br><br>

Linux technology dominates the servers and desktops of animation and
special effects motion picture production. Most of the blockbuster
movies you see in theaters today were produced using Linux. How did an
operating system designed as a hobby by a college student become number
one in Hollywood? How is Linux used for production at studios such as
DreamWorks, ILM, and Disney?<br><br>

CinePaint is an open source frame-by-frame paint/retouching program with
features similar to GIMP or Adobe Photoshop. CinePaint is unique in that
it has support for deep paint (that is, images with greater color depth
than 8 bits per channel), a flipbook movie player, and the ability to
handle motion picture file formats such as Cineon, OpenEXR, and 32-bit
TIFF.<br><br>

We're proud to announce that
<a CLASS="light" HREF="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly &amp; Associates</a>
has joined SCALE 2X
as a sponsor. O'Reilly &amp; Associates is the premier information source
for leading-edge computer technologies. The company's books,
conferences, and web sites bring to light the knowledge of technology
innovators. O'Reilly books, known for the animals on their covers,
