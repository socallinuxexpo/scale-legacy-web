	Chris DiBona has been out front and outspoken about the Open Source
	movement. He was hooked from the moment he installed Linux on an old
	PC when he was a teenager.<br><br>

	As DiBona's career as a developer progressed, with stints in information
	management at the U.S. State Department and in computer security with
	Tandem Computers, so did Linux. DiBona eventually joined VA Linux as a
	marketing executive. He became a spokesman for Open Source and wrote a
	book about it: Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution,
	(O'Reilly and Associates, 1999). He was also instrumental in creating
	the Open Source Development Network (OSDN). Chris is also well known
	for being an editor on slashdot.org and for doing the Linux segments on
	TechTV's "The Screen Savers".<br><br>

	In addition to his work at VA Linux, Chris made many contributions to
	the community. He was the vice president of the Silicon Valley LUG and
	a co-organizer of Windows Refund Day. He has also worked for Linux
	International as webmaster and grant chair.<br><br>

	DiBona recently left VA Linux to co-found a gaming development company,
	Damage Studios, which is using Open Source in the development of a
	next-generation massively multiplayer game called Rekonstruction. He
	remains a strong advocate of the Open Source movement and its future.

	<i><b>Chris DiBona's presentation is titled "Open Source: The IP Canary
	in the IT Coal Mine"</b></i><br><br>

	In his talk "Open Source, IP Canary in the IT Coalmine" , Mr. DiBona
	will discuss the way that Free and Open Source Software has and will
	continue to butt heads with Trademark, Trade Secret, Copyright and
	Patent laws, and why that's not such a bad thing.
