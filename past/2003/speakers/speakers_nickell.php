	<i><b>Seth's talk is on The Unified Linux Desktop</b></i><br><br>

	Seth writes:<br><br>
	We are on the brink of being able to build a top-to-bottom
	Linux desktop system that isn't just a thin 1990s venier over a crunchy
	1970s interior.But creating a coherent Linux desktop is going to require
	changes/extensions to the base Linux system. Freedesktop.org is starting to
	provide both a unified desktop voice for communicating with other pieces of
	the Linux software stack, and technical infrastructure such as DBs that
	will allow of system daemons and other components to integrate with the
	desktop
