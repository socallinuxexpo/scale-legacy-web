	Kevin Lawton is the lead developer of two major software projects which
	allow users to run Windows programs on their Linux platform. His first
	project "Bochs" is a portable x86 PC emulator, which runs on most all
	platforms including Linux/x86 and Linux/PPC. Bochs has been developed in an
	open "bazaar" style since its inception in 1994 and has involved some few
	hundred developers. Bochs originally had a commercial license, but it is
	now under an Open-Source license. (LGPL)<br><br>

	In March 1999, Kevin founded the FreeMWare project now known as Plex86, an
	open source alternative to the commercial software from VMware(TM). Plex86
	quickly attracted the attention of many users in search of an open source
	and high-performance way to run Windows applications on Linux and other
	operating systems. Development of Plex86 is progressing rapidly, drawing
	from 6 years of work and a large code base intersect with the Bochs
	project.
