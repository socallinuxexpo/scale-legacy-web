	<i><b>Robin Rowe's talk is: "Linux Movies and CinePaint"</b></i><br><br>

	Linux technology dominates the servers and desktops of animation and special
	effects motion picture production. Most of the blockbuster movies you see in    theaters today were produced using Linux. How did an operating system
	designed as a hobby by a college student become number one in Hollywood? How
	is Linux used for production at studios such as DreamWorks, ILM, and Disney?<br><br>

	Despite running on open source Linux, most of the software tools used in
	Hollywood are proprietary or even secret. There is an exception. CinePaint
	is an open source frame-by-frame paint/retouching program with features
	similar to GIMP or Adobe Photoshop. What makes CinePaint special is support
	for deep paint (that is, images with greater color depth than 8 bits per
	channel), a flipbook movie player, and the ability to handle motion picture
	file formats such as Cineon, OpenEXR, and 32-bit TIFF.<br><br>
