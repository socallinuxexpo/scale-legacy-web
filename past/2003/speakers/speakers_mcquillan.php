	Jim has been developing solutions for customers,
	utilizing Unix and networking since 1984 and has been
	involved with Linux since 1995. Jim has functioned as
	a Chief Technologist for more than 17 years and is
	responsible for the successful deployment of health
	care systems throughout the North Eastern United States.
	Additionally, Jim is the founder and project leader
	of the Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP), a free software
	project which has received world wide recognition as the
	standard method of deploying thin clients in a GNU/Linux
	environment.<br><br>

	<i><b>Jim's presentation centers around the Linux Terminal Server Project:</b></i><br><br>

	The Linux Terminal Server Project (http://www.LTSP.org)
	is an open source project whose focus is to provide
	everything you need to run thin client computers in a
	GNU/Linux environment.<br><br>
	
	The LTSP has been deployed in hundreds of thousands of
	locations throughout the world, in homes, small offices,
	large offices, schools, universities, libraries, government
	agencies, cyber cafes and more.<br><br>
	
	The LTSP is an excellent way to deploy large numbers of
	workstations very inexpensively.  By eliminating the
	moving parts from a workstation, the reliability is
	greatly increased.  Also, there are huge cost savings,
	both in terms of initial cost of deployment and total
	cost of ownership (TCO).<br><br>
