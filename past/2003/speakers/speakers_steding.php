	Broadcasting Network</a><br><br>

	In the spirit of the open source movement, LPBN has brought together
	representatives from three innovative independent media organizations and
	a computer technology training project.  Questions of providing public
	access via alternative and conventional media distribution systems will be
	explored.  Presentations bind the technical, activist, and creative
	aspects spontaneously arising from the open source environment of Linux.
	Included will be a presentation by Raymond Steding of LPBN.ORG on the
	process of releasing original works under creative commons licensing and
	then how to make efficient use of each of these organization's
	media distribution systems.<br><br>
