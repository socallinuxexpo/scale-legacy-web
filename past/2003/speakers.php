	Last year, we invited many prominent members of the Linux and Open Source
	Community to speak at the first annual Southern California Linux Expo.
	Those who gave presentations at SCALE included Robert Love (Linux kernel
	developer, author of the preemptive kernel patch), Rasmus Lerdorf (Author
	of PHP), and Marc Hamilton (Director of Global Education and Research, Sun Microsystems).
	<br><br>
	We are working hard to bring out another great set of speakers to inform
	and enlighten the audience about Linux and Open Source Software. If you
	know someone that is interested, or if you are interested in seeing a
	particular speaker, please
