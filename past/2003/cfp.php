	The USC, Simi/Conejo, and UCLA Linux User Groups are proud to present the
	second annual Southern California Linux Expo scheduled for November 22nd,
	2003 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The Southern California Linux
	Expo will bring together Linux and Open Source Software companies,
	developers, and users.<br><br> 

	The conference is being held by Linux user groups from the local area: the
	USCLUG, SCLUG, and UCLALUG. Building on the tremendous success of last
	year's SCALE, the three LUGs will expand on previous LUG Fests to promote
	Linux and the Open Source Software community.<br><br> 

	We INVITE you to share your work on Linux and Open Source projects with the
	rest of the community.<br><br> 

	Presentations can be in the form of speeches, tutorials, or demonstrations.
	A speech on Linux's uses in multimedia, a tutorial on iptables
	(demonstrating routing and firewall applications in Linux), or a
	demonstration of projects such as games, are just some examples of
	appropriate material.
