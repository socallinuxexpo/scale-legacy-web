	This event will provide new insight in the growing
	technological Linux community and where it is headed.  This operating
	system created by a grass roots effort has grown robust enough to be

	Expo will contain a blend of business leaders and technical experts that
	are required to truely understand where Linux is at and where it will be
	in 10 years.
