	<p CLASS="bgblack">Dan Kegel Presents: Linux In Universities</p>

	<p CLASS="bgwhite">
	Businesses and universities are hiring people with Linux Skills, deploying
	Linux on servers, and evaluating Linux on the desktop. Microsoft's pricing
	and policies have made Linux an attractive alternative. University IT
	departments should start planning to support Linux on the desktop in
	recognition of its increased importance.<br>

	<p CLASS="bgblack">Rasmus Lerdorf Presents: PHP - Scripting the Web</p>

	<p CLASS="bgwhite">
	Rasmus Lerdorf born in Godhavn/Qeqertarsauq on Disco Island off the coast
	of Greenland in 1968. He has been dabbling with UNIX-based solutions since
	1985. He's known for having gotten the PHP project off the ground in 1995,
	the mod_info Apache module and he can be blamed for the ANSI92 SQL-defying
	LIMIT clause in mSQL 1.x which has now, at least conceptually, crept into
	both MySQL and PostgresSQL. Rasmus discusses PHP's application to web
	scripting.<br>

	<p CLASS="bgwhite">
	The Linux kernel 2.5 development series culminated nearly a year of rapid
	development with the feature freeze on 31 October. Numerous new features
	and enhancements were merged to further increase Linux's performance and
	robustness. This talk discusses some of the more interesting and relevant
	new innovations in the kernel including, but not limited to, block I/O
	enhancements, new O/(1) scheduler, kernel preemption, new reverse-mapping
	VM, and thread enhancements.<br>

	<p CLASS="bgblack">Darren Moffat Presents: Administering Solaris and Linux
	Securely</p>

	<p CLASS="bgwhite">
	An all powerful single user account is often too much power in one person's
	hands to perform the jobs they need to do. A form of RBAC (Role Based
	Access Control) has been available in versions of Solaris for over then
	years but only became main stream in Solaris 8. Darren gives an overview of
	some of the areas of compatibility and divergence in the OS security
	features of Solaris and Linux<br>

	<p CLASS="bgblack">Tim Jones of the Tolis Group Presents: Backup and
	Recovery</p>

	<p CLASS="bgwhite">
	Linux, unlike many other Unix environments, is actually very easy to recover
	after a system failure or other disaster - IF you have appropriate backups
	and boot media and a disaster recovery plan. By defining system backups
	appropriately, ensuring that you have a full listing of the necessary
	hardware (in case you have to replace the entire system), having a manual
	operation plan while the recovery is occurring, and keeping boot media and
	system backups offsite, everyone - from the smallest business to the
	largest corporation can easily turn a system disaster into an non-event.
	The presentation examines various recovery scenarios and builds a sample
	disaster recovery plan centered around Linux<br>

	system and the new device model in the ongoing 2.5 kernel development
	series. He will elaborate on the need of the new device driver model with
	emphasis on the accompanying driverfs implementation and its benefits.<br>
