	Conference Center
	</p>

	<p CLASS="bgwhite">
	We will be charging for this event in order to cover the expenses
	associated with organizing it, not to make a profit. Our goal is for
	attendees to gain new insight and excitement about our growing
	technological community.

	The first large scale professional Linux expo in Los Angeles is being held
	by Linux users groups from the local area: the USCLUG, SCLUG, and UCLALUG.
	The three LUGs combines their efforts to expand on previous LUG Fests and
	bring forward an exposition to promote Linux and the Open Source Software
	community.
