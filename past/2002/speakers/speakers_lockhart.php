	Thomas Lockhart began his technical career working in the field of Very
	Long Baseline Interferometry as a data analyst and systems developer for
	VLBI correlators at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a NASA facility in
	Pasadena, California. He designed and built the systems used for data
	collection, transmission, assembly, and integrated data management for the
	NASA Global GPS Network implemented in the 1990s. This system uses Ingres,
	a commercial RDBMS, as the data management backbone of the near-real-time
	data collection system, and handles ~300MB of GPS tracking data per
	day.<br><br>

	He has implemented data acquisition systems on a global scale, and is
	familiar with the communications issues related to data acquisition and
	delivery throughout the world.<br><br>

	Fluent with C++, C, Fortran, FORTH, Pascal, SQL, Ingres4GL, perl, lex,
	yacc, Tom has also acquired systems experience with Linux, HPUX,
	SunOS/Solaris, DEC (Unix and VMS). He is an active participant in Open
	Source software development, including TAO (a real-time CORBA package) and
	as a core member of the PostgreSQL group.<br><br>
