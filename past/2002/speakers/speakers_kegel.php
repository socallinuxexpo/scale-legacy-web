	Dan Kegel is a software engineer who maintains lalugs.org as a service to
	the Los Angeles Linux community. He has been programming since 1978, and
	mentoring intern programmers since 1994. His web site "The C10K Problem" is
	well-known among a small circle of internet server programmers, and his
	Tunney Act comment in the Microsoft antitrust case attracted 2300
	cosigners.<br><br>
	
	<i>Dan will be presenting his latest research project - "Linux in
	Universities"</i><br><br>

	Businesses and universities are hiring people with Linux skills, deploying
	Linux on servers to save money, and even evaluating Linux on the desktop.
	Microsoft's pricing and security policies have made Linux an attractive
	alternative. Linux's open source nature makes it an excellent tool for
	teaching. Linux now comes with free alternatives to Internet Explorer and
	Microsoft Office which work well enough for the average user. University IT
	departments should start planning to support Linux on the desktop in
	recognition of its increased importance.
