	Born in Godhavn/Qeqertarsuaq on Disco Island off the coast of Greenland in
	1968. He has been dabbling with UNIX-based solutions since 1985. Known for
	having gotten the PHP project off the ground in 1995, the mod_info Apache
	module and he can be blamed for the ANSI92 SQL-defying LIMIT clause in mSQL
	1.x which has now, at least conceptually, crept into both MySQL and
	PostgreSQL.<br><br>

	He tends to deny being a programmer, preferring to be seen as a techy adept
	at solving problems. If the solution requires a bit of coding and he can't
	trick somebody else into writing the code, he will reluctantly give in and
	write the code. According to Google he is a famous Dane currently living
	near San Francisco with his wife, Christine.<br><br>
