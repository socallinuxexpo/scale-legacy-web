	Tim Jones is the president and chief technology officer of the TOLIS Group,
	Inc., the developer of the BRU brand of data backup and recovery software.
	In 1994, Tim's vision to port BRU to Linux produced the first commercial,
	non-development application to support Linux systems at Linux kernel level
	0.00pl12. At the time, Tim was the vice president of engineering at
	Enhanced Software Technologies, Inc., the original developer of BRU. Tim's
	14 year tenure in the data storage and backup industry includes product
	management positions at Archive Corporation and Conners Peripherals. Prior
	to putting the TOLIS Group together, Tim was the director of research and
	development at EBIZ Enterprises.<br><br>
	
	Tim has been actively involved in the furthering of Linux through the
	development of Linux International, the Linux Standards Base project, the
	Linux Posix project, the Linux Professional Institute. TOLIS is the sponsor
	of the Linux Tape Device Certification Program.<br><br>

	<i>Tim will present "Linux System Disaster Recovery Planning"</i><br><br>

	Linux, unlike many other Unix environments, is actually very easy to
	recover after a system failure or other disaster - *IF* you have
	appropriate backups and boot media and a disaster recovery plan.<br><br>

	By defining system backups appropriately, ensuring that you have a full
	listing of the necessary hardware (in case you have to replace the entire
	system), having a manual operation plan while the recovery is occurring,
	and keeping boot media and system backups offsite, everyone - from the
	smallest business to the largest corporation can easily turn a system
	disaster into a non-event.<br><br> 

	We will examine various recovery scenarios and build a sample disaster
	recovery plan centered around a Linux environment."
