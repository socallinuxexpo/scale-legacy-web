	<h3>Announcing SCALE 3X</h3>

	<p>
	The Linux Expo of Southern California, a joint effort of the USC, UCLA,
	and Simi-Conejo Linux Users Groups, is proud to announce the third
	annual Southern California Linux Expo.
	</p>

	<p>
	Last year's Expo was a great success, with over 800 people attending. So
	mark your calendars again!
	</p>

	<p>
	SCALE 3x will expand upon the success of the two previous Expos to
	promote Linux and Open Source Software in Southern California. Because
	the Expo has been growing year over year, SCALE 3X has been expanded to
	two days, with more talks, tutorials and seminars! It's set for February
	12th and 13th, 2005 at the Los Angeles Convention Center.
