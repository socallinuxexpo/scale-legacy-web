	The Linux Expo of Southern California was established in 2001. Our
	mission is to evangelize the advantages of Open Source software. Open
	Source software is any software that meets the litmus test of the OSI
	(Open Source Initiative). Examples of OSS are Linux, the various BSD
	operating systems, and applications such as OpenOffice.org and Mozilla.
	</p>

	<p>
	Our target audiences are both current and potential users of OSS. Those
	users can be individual computer users, educational institutions, or
	businesses.

	community together in a way that no other conference does!
