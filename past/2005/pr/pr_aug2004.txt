The Southern California Linux Expo has signed these notable Open Source
people to speak at SCALE 3x, the third annual So Cal Linux Expo:

John "Maddog" Hall of Linux International

Jeff Waugh, head of the GNOME Release Team and former president of the
Sydney Linux User's Group

SCALE 3X will be held February 12th and 13th, 2005, at the Los Angeles
Convention Center.

The Linux Expo of Southern California was established in 2001. Our
mission is to evangelize the advantages of Open Source software. Open
Source software is any software that meets the litmus test of the OSI
(Open Source Initiative). Examples of OSS are Linux, the various BSD
operating systems, and applications such as OpenOffice.org and Mozilla.

Our target audiences are both current and potential users of OSS. Those
users can be individual computer users, educational institutions, or
businesses.

SCALE - bringing businesses, academic institutions and the Linux
community together in a way that no other conference does!
