	<h3>Clint Oram</h3>

	<p>
	Clint Oram is the Open Source Project leader for SugarCRM.
	His experience began with some large CRM companies - and
	he resigned that corporate track to start the open source project named
	SugarCRM.  The SugarCRM project was built on the LAMP stack, and is
	quite a powerful application (for more info, go to www.sugarcrm.com).
	His open source project was recognized in October as a project of the
	month, and is often found as a top 10 in most active projects on
	Sourceforge.net.
