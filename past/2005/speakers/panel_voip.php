	<h3>Panel: The future of VoIP and Open Source</h3>

	<p>
	Leaders from the VoIP and open source communities will cover topics relevant to the future of open source Voice Over IP (VoIP) efforts. Subtopics will include the effects of government regulation on peer to peer (P2P) / open-source VoIP projects, current future VoIP standards, as well as technical and legal hurdles.<br /><br />

	Voice over IP, also known as IP Telephony, is a technology which allows for voice communications over the Internet and other IP based networks. VoIP allows for lower cost calls than traditional telecommunications networks.  According to a recent Gartner Dataquest forecast, VoIP related revenues in 2005 should hit $10.6 billion and are expected grow to $24 billion in 2008. With this type of growth it is no wonder VoIP is the focus of major corporations and governments around the globe.  SCALE 3x's seminars and panels will help you learn more about current and future open-source VoIP technologies, as well as provide you with the information you need to work with the coming developments and regulations.<br /><br />
