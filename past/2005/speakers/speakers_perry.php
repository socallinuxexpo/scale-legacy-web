	<h3>Linux in Embedded Systems for Engineers</h3>

	<p>
	This talk contrasts the advantages of software development using a full
	Debian Linux distribution on the desktop with the more restrictive and
	different challenges of an embedded target where many of the goodies go
	away.<br /><br />

	On embedded targets the software footprint is generally minimized.
	Standardized service protocols, and integrated networking support of
	the configurable Linux kernel, enable use of complicated open source
	applications that are otherwise too large to be used in conjunction
	with small computers and microcontrollers.<br /><br />

	Where there is a complicated need that exceeds the resources of your
	widget, these protocols also mean you can run some or all of the
	application on a server somewhere else - over the network. The inherent
	security models (including role based) enable information sharing
	between widgets, to distribute the storage and computational effort
	across an array, to build a big picture without risking the security of
	individual sensors (for example).<br /><br />

	After discussing the software utilities commonly used for building a
	product around Open Source technologies, the talk will summarize the
	importance of licensing and discuss the General Public License (GPL)
	and how it assists in the development of new products.
