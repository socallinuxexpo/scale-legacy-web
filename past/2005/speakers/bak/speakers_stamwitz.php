	<h3>Affordable iSCSI: Building storage systems with commodity hardware</h3>

	<p>
	With iSCSI initiator support in Linux and commercially available target
	software, integrators and system providers now have the option to build
	cost-effective iSCSI storage systems using off-the-shelf hardware. This
	session will describe several ways in which systems can be built as
	well as those applications that are best suited for these systems.
	Issues such as performance, configuration, and redundancy will also be
	discussed.
