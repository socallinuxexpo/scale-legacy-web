	Synopsis: Leading the way in medical open source, ClearHealth/OpenEMR
	offers a next generation medical suite with support for scheduling,
	billing, and electronic medical records. It is the only 100% solution
	for professional practices to do practice management, EMR and billing
	without using any proprietary software. Written in PHP using modern
	design methodology, and object oriented code it has confronted unique
	challenges in the medical vertical market.<br /><br />

	While taking a look specifically at that project we will also be looking
	at what role Free &amp; Open Source software plays in the overall industry
	as well as how the medical context impacts developing software.
	Complexities like un-standards, regulation and privacy/security concerns
	makes this in interesting and unique topic.
