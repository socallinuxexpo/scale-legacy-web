	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	<p>
	For years now we've been worried about patent and copyright attacks
	against open source projects.  Now they are here.  With Open Source
	Software reaching the commercial mainstream, SCO is just the tip of the
	iceberg. Patent, DMCA, and other copyright attacks are on the horizon.
	This talk will walk through the current threats to open source
	projects, including SCO v. Linux, Acacia's patent threats over
	streaming media and Wifi, as well as Blizzard's DMCA case against the
	BNETD Project. The session will also discuss what the defendants in
	these suits might have done to minimize or extinguish their risk of
	being sued, if anything.  Finally, we'll talk about what we can all do
	to make OSS projects less vulnerable in the future, including changes
	to the law as well as building community defense resources.
