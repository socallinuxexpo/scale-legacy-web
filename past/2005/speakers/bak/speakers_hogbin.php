	<h3>Emma Jane Hogbin</h3>

	<p>
	Emma Jane Hogbin is a Toronto-based developer, technical author and
	instructor. Her lively presentation style is currently applied at Humber
	College in the School of Media Studies &amp; Information Technology
	where she teaches standards-compliant web development. She contributes
	to <a href="http://www.tldp.org">The Linux Documentation Project</a>
	as the I18N Coordinator, and is co-author of the LDP's Author Guide.
	</p>

	<h3>Documentation: Supporting Users and Developers</h3>

	<p>
	Everyone benefits from good documentation, but few developers are
	equipped to document their own projects. Emma will walk the audience through
	documentation from:

	<ul>
	<li>a beginner's perspective (where to find documentation)</li>
	<li>a developer's perspective (how to write accurate documentation</li>
	<li>an author's perspective (how to markup documentation using DocBook XML).</li>
	</ul>

	Specific examples will be drawn from The Linux Documentation Project to help the
	audience find the documentation that already exists, and write the
	documentation that doesn't. This presentation promises to make
	documentation more interesting than you ever thought possible.
