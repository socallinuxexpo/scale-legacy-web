	Group</a>, Inc., the developer of the BRU brand of data backup and recovery
	software. In 1994, Tim's vision to port BRU to Linux produced the first
	commercial, non-development application to support Linux systems at
	Linux kernel level 0.00pl12. At the time, Tim was the vice president
	of engineering at Enhanced Software Technologies, Inc., the original
	developer of BRU. Tim's 14 year tenure in the data storage and backup
	industry includes product management positions at Archive Corporation

	<h3>10 pounds of backup in a 5 pound window - Improving Backup Planning for Growing Environments</h3>

	<p>
	With Backup windows becoming smaller - because of either the amount of
	data being backed up or extended work hours being seen in many
	establishments - backup methods and procedures for reducing the
	requirement are becoming more important than ever before.  Also, with
	the myriad new regulations concerning archival of data, extended and
	offsite storage planning becomes more important.<br /><br />

	We will discuss many old and new procedures that can be used in most
	administration environments to alleviate or reduce the backup load.
	The discussion will include:

	<ul>
	<li>Full vs. Incremental vs. Differential Backups</li>
	<li>Using Multiple Servers/Tape drives</li>
	<li>Using Libraries with Multiple Drives</li>
	<li>Using Disk to Disk and Disk to Disk to Tape</li>
	<li>Using new Virtual Tape Libraries</li>
	<li>Remote Storage - Near Line or Off Line</li>
	</ul>
