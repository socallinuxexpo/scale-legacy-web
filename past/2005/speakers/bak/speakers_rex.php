	<h3>Dennis Rex</h3>

	<p>
	Dennis a business development manager for a large software company and
	have been in the computer industry for almost 30 years - everything
	from field service and management to UNIX system sales in major
	accounts.  His foray into Linux began about two years ago after a
	"last straw" moment with Windows, thinking that there must be a better
	way.<br /><br />

	With a background in radio, Dennis was drawn to wireless networking and
	have made it a bit of a hobby. Because there are some unique challenges
	to wireless in a Linux context, he try to share his experiences with
	others whenever he can.
