	<h3>Abstract</h3>

	<p>
	LESS IS MORE with "true" diskless client networks and server-centric
	computing, as proven by savvy schools, government agencies and even
	businesses now simultaneously running Linux, Open Systems and Windows,
	along with Internet access . . . all at the speed of the server.
	<br /><br />

	In this session, Gideon Romm, co-founder of industry leader Symbio
	Technologies, will offer first-hand insights and advice on how to:

	<ul>
	<li>save money with a diskless thin client networks</li>
	<li>be secure against viruses and software that can become corrupted</li>
	<li>provide access to a wider number and variety of programs while eliminating vendor lock-in through multiple OS's and Open Systems</li>
	<li>save further still by recycling old PC's (even 486's!) into clients on high-speed networks.</li>
	</ul>
