	<h3>Abstract</h3>

	<p>
	Glenn will describe how the Linux COTS strategy enables telecom
	equipment providers to drastically reduce the months of engineering
	time typically spent on platform development and maintenance. He will
	detail the Linux-based COTS advantages that the end-user telecom firms
	realize, including greater openness and flexibility in the development
	tools; the greater range of architectures supported; and the appeal of
	open-source software availability.
