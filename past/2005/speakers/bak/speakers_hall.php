	Free and Open Source has often been heralded as a method for third
	world countries to bridge the Digital Divide. As the speaker has
	traveled the world he has seen many examples of how closed-source,
	proprietary software has impeded progress, and how Free and Open Source
	Software (FOSS) has allowed progress to resume, creating jobs and
	solving problems. Yet in the most powerful country on earth, in some of
	the richest companies the closed nature of proprietary software has a
	hidden cost that keeps them from moving forward.<br /><br />
	This talk explains how the use of FOSS may help propell so-called
	"third world nations" ahead of the United States, saving them time and
	money.
