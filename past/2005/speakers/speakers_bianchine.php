	<h3>Jefferey Bianchine</h3>

	<p>
	Jefferey J. Bianchine has had an interesting career managing computing
	in a variety of challenging work environments since the 1980's. He has
	particularly enjoyed a career as more generalist than specialist,
	because of the broad range of experiences it has afforded: developing
	mission-critical applications; developing and delivering training;
	consulting during civil litigation; troubleshooting; and teaching as
	adjunct faculty at local colleges.<br /><br />

	As a professional systems administrator in a variety of settings he
	has managed operations based upon Apple, SGI, Sun, and various x86
	systems, deploying both proprietary and open operating systems and
	applications. Can you hazard a guess at which he prefers?<br /><br />

	Jefferey earned degrees in Psychology and Management from Syracuse
	University. He bills himself as an MBA, "that can actually DO stuff,"
	when asked about his degree. His first public speaking about computers
	was a demonstration of his brand new NEC 8201 for the Syracuse Kaypro
	User Group and his most recent before SCALE 3X was SambaXP 2003.<br /><br />

	<h3>Developing Management Strategies and Tools for Samba</h3>

	<p>
	Samba provides resource sharing services that are absolutely vital to
	the successful migration to a Free and Open Source infrastructure.
	Despite this gravity, installation is as simple as installing smbd and
	nmbd on resource sharing hosts and then configuring smb.conf to
	effectively describe the required sharing.<br /><br />

	Simple, yes, but this is just the beginning of life with Samba. There
	are processes to monitor, logs to analyze, shares to administer, and
	users to manage. The very nature of cross platform integration is one
	of change (gradualand dramatic) so administrative tasks can become
	increasingly complicated over time.<br /><br />

	This talk presents practical ideas about Samba planning and management,
	emphasizing configuration planning and tool development to facilitate
	ongoing administration. Existing administrative tools are examined and
	new tool development discussed.
