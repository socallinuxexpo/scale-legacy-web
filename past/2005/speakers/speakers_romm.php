	Gideon Romm has been involved with UNIX and Linux for ten years and been instrumental in bringing new technologies to market. Active in a number of open source projects including LTSP (Linux Terminal Server Project), he has several patents pending in hardware electronics. As head of research and development at Symbio Technologies, he uses his experience gained in designing integrated circuits for the copper, fiber optic, infrared, and RF wireless communications industries while at Level One Communications (now an Intel company), Hewlett Packard, Philips Semiconductors, and Agilent.<br /><br />
	He has developed software used in research done by the Mahoney Institute of Neurological Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania, with results published by the International Society for Autonomic Neuroscience.<br /><br />
	Mr. Romm earned an M.S. in Electrical Engineering (MSEE) and a B.S. in Science and Engineering (BSE) in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania, and has completed course work at Stanford University.<br /><br />
	Mr. Romm is the co-founder of Symbio Technologies located New Rochelle, NY. His company is actively engaged in developing diskless thin client technology which offers a server-centric alternative to PCs on the desktop.

	<h3>Abstract</h3>

	<p>
	LESS IS MORE with "true" diskless client networks and server-centric
	computing, as proven by savvy schools, government agencies and even
	businesses now simultaneously running Linux, Open Systems and Windows,
	along with Internet access . . . all at the speed of the server.
	<br /><br />

	In this session, Gideon Romm, co-founder of industry leader Symbio
	Technologies, will offer first-hand insights and advice on how to:

	<ul>
	<li>save money with a diskless thin client networks</li>
	<li>be secure against viruses and software that can become corrupted</li>
	<li>provide access to a wider number and variety of programs while eliminating vendor lock-in through multiple OS's and Open Systems</li>
	<li>save further still by recycling old PC's (even 486's!) into clients on high-speed networks.</li>
	</ul>
