	<h3>Linux Desktop development using SVG</h3>

	<p>
	The <a href="http://www.svg.org">SVG</a> standard is an XML definition for vectored graphics defined by
	the W3C. Targeted at the web, this standard is being integrated into
	Open Source Desktops. Inkscape is an open-source cross-platform
	graphical illustration program based on the SVG graphics standard.
	Inkscape allows users to create graphics for the web, desktop, cell
	phone or PDA with an easy to use interface implementing the majority of
	the SVG program. Inkscape is listed by many as one of the top Linux
	applications and it is working to assist in the "SVG Revolution" across
	the Linux desktop. This presentation will cover basics of the SVG
	standard, use of SVG in the Linux desktop, and an introduction to
	creating SVG graphics with Inkscape.
