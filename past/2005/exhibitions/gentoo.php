	We produce Gentoo Linux, a special flavor of Linux that can be automatically optimized
	and customized for just about any application or need. Extreme configurability, performance
	and a top-notch user and developer community are all hallmarks of the Gentoo experience.
	<br /><br />

	Thanks to a technology called Portage, Gentoo Linux can become an ideal secure server,
	development workstation, professional desktop, gaming system, embedded solution or
	something else -- whatever you need it to be. Because of its near-unlimited adaptability,
	we call Gentoo Linux a metadistribution.<br /><br />

	Portage is the heart of Gentoo Linux, and performs many key functions. For one, Portage
	is the software distribution system for Gentoo Linux. To get the latest software for
	Gentoo Linux, you type one command: emerge --sync. This command tells Portage to update
	your local "Portage tree" over the Internet. Your local Portage tree contains a complete
	collection of scripts that can be used by Portage to create and install the latest
	Gentoo packages. Currently, we have more than 8000 packages in our Portage tree, with new
	ones being added all the time.<br /><br />
