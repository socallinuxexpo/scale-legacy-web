	Zope is an easy-to-learn, highly productive, highly scalable
	web-application platform built with Python. A growing body of
	ready-to-use, ready-to-customize free software packages makes
	Zope even more compelling as a development platform.
	The Los Angeles Zope Users Group will demonstrate Plone
	(content management system), ZWiki (collaborative authoring groupware),
	and OIO (forms-based medical and eCommerce database application
	platform). Single CD Live demo and rapid installation capabilities
	will be demonstrated using LivePlone and LiveOIO Knoppix-based     
	distributions.

	We meet on 3rd Wednesday of each month on Harbor-UCLA campus in
	Torrance.  Agenda are published on LAZUG.Org one week
	prior to each meeting. New users, Zope-related presentations, and
	old friends are cordially invited.
