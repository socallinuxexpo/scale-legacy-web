	KDE is a network transparent contemporary desktop environment for UNIX workstations.
	KDE seeks to fill the need for an easy to use desktop for Unix workstations, similar
	to the desktop environments found under the MacOS or Microsoft Windows. We believe
	that the UNIX operating system is the best operating system available today. In fact
	UNIX has been the undisputed choice of the information technology professional for
	many years. <br /><br />
	
	When it comes to stability, scalability and openness there is no 
	competition to UNIX. However, the lack of an easy to use contemporary desktop 
	environment for UNIX has prevented UNIX from finding its way onto the desktops of 
	the typical computer user in offices and homes. UNIX dominates the server market and
	is the preferred computing platform for computing professional and scientists. Without
	UNIX the internet would not be. But UNIX did not address the needs of the average computer
	user. This fact is particularly unfortunate since a number of implementations of 
	UNIX (Debian GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD etc.) are freely available on the internet. All
	of which are of exceptional quality and stability.
