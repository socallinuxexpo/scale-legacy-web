        Begun in June 1993, FreeBSD aims to conform to the Single
	UNIX Specification.  Its kernel, C library and basic utilities
	are maintained "under one roof" in synchrony, mainly under
	a business-friendly licence. Originally intended only for
	the PC, it is now available for other computer architectures
	such as Alpha, AMD64, Itanium, and UltraSPARC.  It runs
	nearly two million Web sites but is also well-suited for
	appliance-type devices or workstations.<br><br>
	Several programmers who work on various parts of the system will        
	be on hand.  CD-ROMs provided by the FreeBSD Mall will be given         
	away.  A computer with FreeBSD will be available for exploration.<br>
