	Mambo is a full-featured content management system that can be used for everything from simple websites to complex corporate applications. 
	The Mambo Development Team focuses on building a solid application framework rather than on add-ons that are typically found in many portal solutions.
	This keeps the Mambo core extremely lightweight and efficient, thus making it easier for anybody to extend Mambo through custom third party component
	and modules that directly serve their needs. Mambo is released under the GNU General Public license (GNU GPL).<br /><br />
