	ObjectWeb is an open-source software community created at the end of 1999 by Bull, 
	France Telecom R&amp;D and INRIA. Its goal is the development of open-source distributed
	middleware, in the form of flexible and adaptable components. These components range
	from specific software frameworks and protocols to integrated platforms. ObjectWeb
	developments follow a systematic component-based approach.<br /><br />

	In 2002, ObjectWeb evolved into an international consortium hosted by INRIA, the 
	French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control. The consortium
	is an independent non-profit organization open to companies, institutions and individuals.
