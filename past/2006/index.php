	<h3>Conference Info</h3>

	<p>
	Welcome to the fourth annual Southern California Linux Expo!
	Held Saturday and Sunday, <b>February 11-12, 2006, at The Radisson Los
	Angeles Airport,</b>
	SCALE 4x promises to be everything you have come to expect
	from your Open Source community and much more.<br /><br />

	Our first year at this new location, SCALE 4x offers expanded floor
	space allowing for more for you to see and do, like an increased number
	of tutorial sessions designed to show users of all skill levels what
	Open Source can do and how to do it.<br /><br />
	
	In addition to
	expanded tutorials, SCALE 4x offers more booth space for those
	interested in showing how they have made Open Source work for them.
	The booths are also a place to discover Open Source user groups in your
	area and meet and talk with some of the members. Whatever your
	interest in Open Source, SCALE 4x has something for you. For those
	staying over, The Radisson is offering special hotel room rates. $99 / night with a maximum occupancy of 4.<br /><br />
