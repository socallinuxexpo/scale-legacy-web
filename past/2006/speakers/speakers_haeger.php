	<h3>Desktop Innovation on Linux at Novell</h3>

	<p>
	Having pioneered and lead enterprise networking starting in the 1980's and through the 1990's, Novell has been making a radical shift to embrace open source software and Linux over the past three years.  Novell's recent integration of two well-known Linux companies, Ximian and SuSE, have positioned Novell at the forefront of innovation on desktop Linux. Today at Novell, the leadership of open source luminaries such as Nat Friedman, Miguel de Icaza, and many others are driving desktop Linux forward at a phenomenal rate. This presentation will discuss and demonstrate some of the latest innovations that Novell has been putting into the SUSE Linux and the much anticipated release of Novell Linux Desktop 10 in 2006.
