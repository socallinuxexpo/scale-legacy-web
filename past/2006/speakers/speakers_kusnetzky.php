	<h3>Dynamic IT and the New Workplace</h3>

	<p>
	Organizations are increasingly depending upon a highly mobile workforce, one that is less and less likely to be sitting at a desk in an office somewhere.  The new workplace is based upon technology that allows workers to collaborate, to access critical information, from wherever they are, from whatever device they choose, all in real time. This session explores how dynamic IT can support workers in the new workplace.
