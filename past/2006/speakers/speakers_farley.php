	One of those computer wunderkinds, Andrew excelled early in his youth at gaming, then programming and H/W and S/W design. While attending technical college, he co-founded NeonSurge and created the first LANDisk - a custom Linux kernel on a single-board computer. NeonSurge has also created biometric devices, custom media content servers, an award-winning game, and web sites. One of his latest products is a Linux-based multi-port, cross-platform fax server. Andrew's technical interests include scripting languages, WiFi, game programming, cryptography and security.
