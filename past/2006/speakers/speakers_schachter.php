	<h3>The B in LAMP</h3>

	<p>
	At the core of data infrastructure, a basic function is for
	information and to be stored and retrieved. In the world of open
	source, the core data manager is often Berkeley DB, a freely
	available open source product with more than 200 million
	deployments. Berkeley DB ships with all components in a LAMP stack,
	including Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Python, and Perl. Attendees
	will learn what Berkeley DB is, what is does, how it is used by each
	of the LAMP components, and how LAMP developers can exploit the power
	of this database that ships with LAMP stack.<br /><br />

	Berkeley DB is a non-relational database and provides an alternative
	to storing all the data in MySQL SQL tables. It also serves as an
	underlying data manager under MySQL's SQL layer. Learn the
	difference between SQL and non-relational data and when it might be
	appropriate to store certain types of data directly in Berkeley DB.
