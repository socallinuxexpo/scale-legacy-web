	<h3>Building the Next Generation Linux Desktop</h3>

	<p>
	In recent months there has been lots of discussion about the next
	generation desktop and how the KDE and GNOME projects are re-thinking
	how their desktops will work. Jono Bacon, an established writer and
	consultant, has sat down, scribbled some odd looking notes on a piece
	of paper and is here to discuss what needs to happen for this next
	generation Linux desktop to become reality. His presentation covers a
	range of anecdotal and technical issues including:

	<ul>
	<li>Where we are - the current state of the desktop, what it looks
	like, how it works and how it is flawed.</li>

	<li>Usability - how usability needs to be at the forefront of desktop
	development, and how we can identify new and more usable ways of
	working.</li>

	<li>Everyone seems to love frameworks - the development of underlying
	technologies needed to support different desktop needs such as high
	definition video and graphics, multimedia, accessibility and
	networking and how tools such as Cairo, Avahi, X.org, GStreamer, HAL
	and others are working on this.</li>

	<li>Hooking the bits together - discussing methods in which
	applications and the desktop can better integrate to increase ease of
	use, improve usability and create a better desktop experience. With
	Open Source, there is so much potential to really optimise the way
	people work and integrate the desktop in different ways, some of which
	are discussed here.</li>

	<li>The challenges facing the Linux community - unfortunately, not
	everything is rosey in the Open Source garden, and there are some key
	underlying problems that need to be overcome such as handing device
	drivers better, more intuitive package management and standardisation.
	</li>
	</ul>
