	<h3>Abstract</h3>

	<p>
	With more than 20 years of independent computer consulting under his belt - including still working with his first customer - Steve is uniquely qualified to address the aspiring consultant.<br /><br />

	Based on his popular paper <a href="http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/be-consultant.html">So you want to be a consultant...?</a>, Steve's talk will touch on points which may not be entirely obvious to one whose background is more on the technical side. These include:

	<ul>
	<li>It's all about the warm fuzzy feeling</li>
	<li>Your customer is more important than your agenda</li>
	<li>Your reputation is more important than you think</li>
	<li>Sometimes you have to use the "M" word</li>
	<li>The customer is not always right</li>
	<li>As long as you're sleeping, you still have inventory</li>
	<li>Speaking at SCALE is good for business</li>
	</ul>
