	<h3>Participatory Testing</h3>

	<p>
	Traditional and existing open source testing methodologies are necessary and
	useful, but they do not take full advantage of

	the "architecture of participation," which makes open source development so
	powerful. SpikeSource's goal is to facilitate the

	adoption of open source software in the enterprise through testing,
	certification, and support services. SpikeSource has

	built a "Participatory Testing System" that allows developers to participate
	by testing their applications as the payload.

	The test submission service provides a collaborative testing environment for
	the open source community to contribute tests to

	help improve the quality of open source components. This talk presents an
	overview of how Participatory Testing can work as

	well as demonstrates associated interfaces and tool sets.
