	<h3>Russell Miller</h3>

	<p>
	"Originally from Toledo, Ohio, Russell Miller has been a Linux/UNIX Systems Administrator for 10 years.  He is also an Open-Source Programmer, having contributed to the KDE project and the Linux kernel, and is the maintainer of two Open-Source projects, Klicker and PacketBL.  He is an active member of the spamfighting community, and would think that spammers were one notch above pond-scum, if that were not so insulting to pond scum.<br /><br />

	Currently he runs Ladyface Consulting, Inc, a Linux Consultancy and webhosting company out of Agoura Hills, California.<br /><br />

	His hobbies are malleting spammers, collecting old computers, playing piano (He has a fairly extensive formal education as a pianist), and he enjoys messing with electronics and geeking out.<br /><br />

	He presently lives in Agoura Hills, California with his four zebra finches, who are very happy to consider him an endless source of high-quality seed."<br /><br />
