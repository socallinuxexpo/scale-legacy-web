	<h3>Open Source: The Highest Stage of Technology Capitalism (Or, "The
	Next Decade of Software")</h3>

	<p>
	When a pure developer phenomenon, open source largely fed that
	audience. Namely, developers writing software for other developers. With
	the rise of viable open source business models, however, open source is
	increasingly permeating every area of software, with many of the most
	promising projects being enterprise applications.<br /><br />

	In this presentation, Matt Asay will highlight both the emerging open source
	business models and the likely commercial opportunities they provide. He
	will build a framework for analyzing where open source is going, and
	identify ways to capitalize on this rising open source tide. Open source
	software is revolutionizing the way software is developed, sold, and
	supported - this presentation will explain why.
