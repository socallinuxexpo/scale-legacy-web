	<p>Foundation for Successful Solutions-Project T.E.C.H. (Project T.E.C.H.) is committed to providing programs and services that prepare people for living and working together in this new millennium. Project T.E.C.H. has been operating its community technology program at the Tom Bradley Youth and Family Center since Spring 2001, and at the South Seas House since Summer 2004.

	<p>Beyond technology skills development and its benefits (high tech), the success of Project T.E.C.H. centers are equally measured by the relationships formed in the process--the sense of self-worth and community that develops among participants (high touch). 

	<p>Their target populations include economically and educationally disadvantaged families, children and youth, seniors, individuals with disabilities, and those open and willing to build relationships across race, class, gender, ability, and culture.
