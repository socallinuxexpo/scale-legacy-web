	The Santa Barbara Linux Users Group (SBLUG) was founded in February

	the dissemination and discussion of information relating to Linux
	and other Open Source technologies.  The SBLUG meets every 2 weeks,

	The Santa Barbara LUG along with some core developers of the <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org">NSLU2-LINUX</a> project will be showing both big and little endian versions of Linux running on the Linksys NSLU2 hardware.
	A NSLU2 is a small low cost network storage device from Linksys. 
	It is designed to share up to two USB HDs or flash drives to a small network using Samba. You can of course flash a replacement firmware on it, and from there, the sky seems to be the limit!
