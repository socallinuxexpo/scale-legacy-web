	<p>The USCLUG are a community of users of various unices such as Linux, *BSD, Solaris, etc. We consist of users ranging from experts to novices, and we exist to promote, discuss, and assist our community with Linux and open source software in general.  Membership is free, open to anyone, and at the moment only really consists of joining one of our mailing lists.  They have monthly meetings which you can find out about here.

	<p>The USCLUG will be showing off the new EXA extension in recent X servers.  These new extensions offer true transparency and shadow effects.
