	LAMPSIG is a special interest group focusing both on backend web development and end user web interfaces.
	The LAMP environment (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) is the SIG's starting point.<br /><br />

	As far as the group is concerned, the open source nature of the platform is its greatest strength.
	So any alternative open source components will work just as well (e.g. FreeBSD AOLServer PostgreSQL Perl).<br /><br />

	The concept of an open source web development and web hosting platform matters much more than the acronym chosen to represent it.<br /><br />
