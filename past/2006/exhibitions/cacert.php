	CAcert.org is a community driven, Certificate Authority that issues certificates to the public at large for free.<br />
CAcert's goal is to promote awareness and education on computer security through the use of encryption, specifically with the X.509 family of standards. We have compiled a document base that has helpful hints and tips on setting up encryption with common software, and general information about Public Key Infrastructures (PKI).
