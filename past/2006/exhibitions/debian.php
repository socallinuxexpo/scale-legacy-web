	Debian is a free operating system (OS) for your computer. An operating
	system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your
	computer run. Debian uses the Linux kernel (the core of an operating
	system), but most of the basic OS tools come from the GNU project;
	hence the name GNU/Linux.<br><br>
	Debian GNU/Linux provides more than a pure OS: it comes with more than
	8710 packages, precompiled software bundled up in a nice format for
	easy installation on your machine.<br><br>
