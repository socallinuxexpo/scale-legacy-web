	<b>Booth #9</b><br>
	<a href="http://www.uuasc.org">Unix Users Association of Southern California</a><br /><br />
	<p>The UUASC is for all persons using UNIX either personally or professionally, or interested in learning more about UNIX. We recognize all varieties of UNIX, including (without prejudice) SCO, Linux, SVr4, Solaris, AIX, HP/UX, and BSD. This is a good place to meet others with similar interests and broaden your skills and knowledge.<p /> 
	<p>There are two UUASC chapters serving Los Angeles and Orange Counties. Details on meeting locations for each chapter are below. We are always looking for interesting presentations and your suggestions are most welcome. <p />
	<p>There are no dues or other membership requirements. More than 300 persons receive our monthly meeting announcements. Meeting attendance varies to as high as 75. Hershel Remer serves as UUASC president and leads a team of volunteers who together manage the club. More volunteers are always needed.  </p>
	<p>UUASC will be showing off the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> and <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</a> operating systems running on <a href="http://www.soekris.com/">Soekris</a> hardware.
