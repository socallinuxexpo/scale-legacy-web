	LinuxChixLA is the Los Angeles chapter of the LinuxChix  community.
	They are a community of women who both like Linux and desire a 
	environment where women support women in computing.  The membership ranges
	from novices to experienced users, and includes professional and amateur 
	programmers, web developers, system administrators, and technical writers.<br><br>
