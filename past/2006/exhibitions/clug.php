	<a href="http://www.cerritoslug.org">Cerritos Linux Users Group</a><br /><br />
	<p>The Cerritos Linux User Group was formed in January of 2000. Their aim is to spread the word about Linux, a free operating system. They meet every last Saturday of the month to share our experiences with Linux and to answer questions anyone might have.

	<p>Cerritos LUG will be showing off SkyPE and the open source alternative Gizmo.
	<p><a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> is a little program for making free calls over the internet to anyone else who also has Skype. It's free and easy to download and use, and works with most computers.
	<p>Gizmo is a free and open source internet phone.  As simple as an instant messenger.
