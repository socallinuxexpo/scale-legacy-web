IMPORTANT NOTICE

After working initially with the Westin LAX Hotel, we've decided that in
order to better serve our attendees and sponsors we should find an
alternate site for SCALE4x. We've found that site - it's the
<a href="http://www.radisson.com/losangelesca_airport">Radisson
Hotel at Los Angeles International Airport</a> It's even closer to LAX
than the Westin, and has a more appropriate combination of expo floor
space, and seminar and breakout rooms. By moving, we can fine-tune our
layout and make SCALE4x even better than we had originally anticipated!

If you've reserved a room at the Westin, you've got lots of time to cancel
it, and make your reservation at the Radisson.  Also, the Westin will
contact anyone who has reserved a room and help them relocate.  They will
also provide shuttle service if anyone shows up for SCALE at their hotel.

See you at SCALE4x!
