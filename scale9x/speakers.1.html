<p>From my Bio. Mark Terranova is a "West Coast Community Developed Software guy". Mark has regularly taught many types of computer classes specializing in the benefits of Linux and Cross-Platform Software.</p>
<p>His involvement started with Ubuntu community. His interest grew to eventually be a Fedora Ambassador. He has helped organize tech events that are fun, along with geeknics - using beer, BBQ, and other ways to create a fun community. He has spent much time in the Pacific Northwest; including Portland, Oregon learning from FreeGeek.org. This knowledge has helped him in his role as co-founder of GidgetKitchen (GK). "Gidget Kitchen donates computers to groups and individuals in need." GK strives to make modern technology simple, empowering, and easy for everyone to understand. The only requirement is "the ability to play well with others."</p>
<p>Mark blames his interest in technical things and electronics on his father Michael. "He gave me a Commodore 64 and helped me get my amateur radio license (N6TBD) at an early age". </p>
<p>If the photo of me that is attached is not satisfactory- I have others located on my Fedora blog-<br />

With a background as a Analog Broadcast engineer, working on high power transmitters, transmission lines and antennas, and as an FPGA and low-level embedded designer he didn't expect to end up as the SysAdmin for a group of high visibility FOSS projects.</p>
<p>In 2003 when he began to edit wiki pages at NSLU2, Tom was rapidly coerced into doing SysAdmin work because "no one else was doing it." He is now the lead admin for the "nas-admin" group of projects housed at OSUOSL including Open Embedded, Angstrom Linux, WebOS-Internals, Optware, NLSU2, NovaPorts and OpenWiz. In his "spare" time he dabbles in embedded kernel development</p>
<p>The increasing need for FOSS SysAdmin recruiting and training, and his evangelism for that cause has become one of his personal crusades in the community and is the focus of his presentation at SCALE. You may encounter him anywhere around SCALE as he executes his many other responsibilities.</p></div>
