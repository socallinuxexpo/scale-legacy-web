<span class="information">

<strong><em>Chris St. Pierre</em> - </strong>Friday February 8th - 9am-12pm<br />
<em><strong>Speaking Topic:</strong> LOPSA: Open-Source Email Systems: One Approach to Spam Fighting</em>
</span>
<p>Chris St. Pierre is the system administrator at Nebraska Wesleyan University, a small but growing liberal arts university. In his three years there, he has lead a charge to document and modernize the computing infrastructure. He has considerable experience and interest in issues of scalability, business continuity, and automation, and enjoys fighting spam in his spare time.<h3>Abstract</h3>This tutorial will take participants through one very successful approach to spam filtering, while admitting that there is no One True Solution.</p><p>It will cover in-depth setup details for RBLs, greylisting, adaptive firewalls, HELO restrictions, ClamAV, SpamAssassin, and end-user tools like whitelists and blacklists; plugins and tweaks to make these tools more effective; potential pitfalls to this (and other) approaches to filtering; and a host of other smaller items, like soliciting feedback from your clients, gathering statistics, and collating log information. It attempts to be MTA-agnostic.

<em><strong>Speaking Topic:</strong> LOPSA: Introduction to Virtualization on Linux with Xen</em>
