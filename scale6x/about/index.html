	<h3>About the Linux Expo of Southern California Inc</h3>
	<p>

	The Linux Expo of Southern California Inc is a non-profit organization
	currently comprised, but not limited to, members of the USCLUG,
	UCLALUG, and SCLUG. Our mission statement is as follows:
	</p>

	<p>
	The mission of SCALE is outreach - our goal is to evangelize the
	advantages of Open Source software. Open Source software is any software that meets the litmus test of the OSI (Open Source Initiative)<sup><a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">1</a></sup>. Examples of OSS are Linux and the various BSD operating systems, and applications such as OpenOffice.org and Mozilla.
	</p>

	<p>
	Our target audiences are both current and potential users of OSS<sup><span title="Yes, we understand that includes every person on the planet..." style="cursor:help;border-bottom:dashed 1px #999;">2</span></sup>. Those users can be individual computer users, educational institutions, or businesses.
	</p>

	<p>
	Those outreach efforts consist mainly of, but are not limited to, the Southern California Linux Expo. The Expo's educational focus is composed of (but not limited to) technical seminars and booths where, among other things, both commercial software and hardware vendors, and local non-profit groups (for example, Linux Users Groups), participate in product display, and software demonstrations and tutorials, respectively.
	</p>

	<p>
	SCALE may host, or participate in, other activities that align with its mission statement.
	</p>

	<p>
	We are a non-profit volunteer organization, and are vendor- and distribution neutral in our outreach efforts.
	</p>

	<h3>About This Website</h3>

	<!-- now you know who to blame ;) //--><br /><br />

	This website should be viewable with any browser. If you have any
	questions or problems, please let us know.<br /><br />

	<h3>Privacy Policy</h3><br />
	<a name="priv"></a>
	The Linux Expo of Southern California gathers personal information from
	people who register to attend the So Cal Linux Expo. This information
	is ONLY used by SCALE to improve future Expos. If other groups that
	participate in SCALE ask for information about attendees to improve
	their offering at SCALE, and we agree to share it, it will be only
	those demographics that are not identifiable to any individual.
	<br /><br />

	We'll treat your personal information like your other valuable
	possessions; with great care.
	<br /><br />

	Note that you can give your badge information to vendors if you're
	interested in getting more information about their products. That's
	voluntary, and SCALE does not participate in that information exchange.
