    <p>At lunch on Friday at SCALE, I struck up a conversation with an attendee.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was illuminating, and as a result I asked Steve Garcia from CSU Bakersfield how he came to be at SCALE. &nbsp;This interview was the result.</p>
<p><strong>Steve, what's your educational background? </strong></p>
<p>I have a Bachelor's in Physics from about 30 years ago.&nbsp; I took a couple  of programming courses (FORTRAN and Pascal, all with punch cards) in  college, but that was about it.&nbsp; I spent the next 20 years in the oil  patch<em> (slang for the oil business - Orv)</em>, using PDP 11/34 minicomputers, then moving on to VAX and then Sun  workstations.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get involved with computers?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>I bought my first PC in 1982, and spent a fair amount of spare time  playing with it.&nbsp; I bought my first modem in 1987, and I decided that  <strong class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>communications<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></strong> was the future of computers. </p>
<p>Around 1991 I joined the local PC user group in order to take over their  BBS system.&nbsp; This was the heyday of Fidonet, that board was my uplink  to Fido, and the sysop wanted to quit.&nbsp; So of course I had to do something  to maintain my fix. </p>
<p>Around 1994 I discovered OS/2, and converted the BBS over to run on it  (well, DOS sessions on top of OS/2.)&nbsp; I continued to use OS/2 as my  primary system, probably until 2002 -- I never did run Windows as a  primary system.&nbsp; I've had to administer Windows networks at one time or  another, but never on my own machines.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get involved with  using Open Source software? </strong></p>
<p>Somewhere around 1996 or 7, I tried my first Linux system.&nbsp; Red Hat  4.something, I think.&nbsp; I was still dialup then, so it was boxed software.  Too big to be downloading.&nbsp; I thought it was interesting, but it was still  a little too crude for me to use as a desktop.&nbsp; I stuck with OS/2. </p>
<p>In 1998, the oilpatch was going through some hard times, and I found  myself in a Dotcom startup as a programmer/system administrator.&nbsp; I had  taught myself C for a project at work, and I'd been using Solaris on my  workstation at work, so neither Unix nor C were a complete mystery to me.  The startup was using both Linux and Solaris in the server room, as well  as a few other Unix flavors.&nbsp; Some time after I started we got a bunch of  HP 9000 PA-RISC systems, so I found myself administering HPUX as well. </p>
<p>Most of us on the technical side were running Linux as our workstations.  Part of the rite of passage was setting up your own system.&nbsp; <span class="moz-smiley-s1" title=":)"><span>:)</span></span>&nbsp; In  addition we had up to 60 or 70 Linux servers, a couple of dozen Solaris  servers, and maybe 20 HPUX machines.&nbsp; Even on the proprietary Unix  machines, most of the installed software was Open Source.&nbsp; It was a couple  of years of intensive immersion in the Open Source world. </p>
<p>In 2001 the bottom fell out of the Dotcom world, and I found myself on my  own.&nbsp; I spent the unemployment time building my programming and  administrations skills.&nbsp; Go O'Reilly! </p>
<p>It was at this time that I shut down my last OS/2 machine at home,  although a well log digitizing company that I was running continued to use  OS/2 as its basis until 2004.&nbsp; I discovered Gentoo Linux about this time  and mostly retired all my Red Hat machines as well. </p>
<p>In 2003 I started as a lecturer/system administrator for the Computer  Science department at Cal State Bakersfield. </p>
<p>We had three computer labs, two running Windows 2000 and one running a mix  of Digital Unix (on Alpha) and Solaris (on Sparc.)&nbsp; Our primary server was  an Alpha, and the new server waiting in the wings was a Sun Sparc running  Solaris 8, which we switched to very shortly thereafter.&nbsp; A few years  later we got a small grant to purchase a small Dell server so we could  experiment with Linux, to see if it would be suitable for our next gen  primary server.&nbsp; I was pretty confident, but my department chair wanted to  run a battery of tests to make sure it would do what he wanted it to do. </p>
<p>He concluded that Linux was much better behaved (in the things he cared  about) than Solaris. </p>
<p>About this time we moved into a new building built and optimized for the  Math and Computer Science departments.&nbsp; Finally a real server room! Along  with this came a grant to furnish the computers, and we now had 5 computer  labs to fill.&nbsp; I took this opportunity to convert all the classroom labs I  could to run Ubuntu.&nbsp; Using VMware Player, we have Windows VMs on each  machine, but students primarily use the base Ubuntu OS.&nbsp; One lab, the  Digital Electronics lab, runs all Windows systems since the  hardware/software combo requires Windows.&nbsp; It turned out not to work in  emulation, so we had to go back to native Windows in that case.&nbsp; The rest  are all Ubuntu, including the advanced Unix lab which is running all Sun  workstations. </p>
<p>At the same time, we were able to get a new primary server, a Dell 6950  with tons of memory and storage.&nbsp; I put Debian Etch on it, and we've been  very happy with it. </p>
<p>Our program is set up so that most classes involve students logging on to  the server and doing their programming assignments directly on the server. </p>
<p>The Ubuntu workstations in the labs have proven to be very easy to maintain.&nbsp; My satisfaction with the last couple of versions of Ubuntu has been dropping, so the next refresh might be something else, I'm not sure what.&nbsp; My personal machines are still running Gentoo, mostly.&nbsp; I won't be switching the labs to Gentoo, however! </p>
