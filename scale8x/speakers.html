Diana now contributes online through forums, personal advocacy, documentation, and bug reports. Furthermore, the expo introduced her to web design, and she has learned to hand code in html/css. Also, the python language has especially caught her attention and she has taught herself to program with the help of books, open courseware, and online tutorials. She is now a happy Ubuntu user and plans to add to her repertoire of programming languages and to help any potential enthusiasts get started. </p>
<p>Diana holds a bachelor's degree in psychology and pre-medical studies from University of California Berkeley. Instead of becoming a doctor, she decided to try other stuff, like high-tech public relations and online marketing. Nowadays, when she is not glued to her computer screen, she is an international flight attendant and enjoys catching glimpses of shooting stars from the window of a 777. She also loves learning new languages, not just those on the computer, and would love a chance to bring tears to your eyes with her French.</p></div>

Besides being the primary author of both git-gui and git-fast-import, Shawn's opinion, backed by his code, has influenced many key design decisions that form the modern git implementation.</p>
<p>In early 2006 Shawn also founded the JGit project, creating a 100% pure Java reimplementation of the Git version control system. The JGit library can often be found in Java based products that interact with Git, including plugins for Eclipse and NetBeans IDEs, the Hudson CI server, Apache Maven, and Gerrit Code Review, a peer code review system specially designed for Git. Today he continues to develop and maintain JGit, EGit, and Gerrit Code Review.</p></div>

While his family of wife and 3 daughters are his top priority, they will all attest to the fact that he evangelizes about Linux at every opportunity.
