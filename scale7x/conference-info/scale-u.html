    <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The SCaLE University training program is presented by the League of Professional System Administrators (LOPSA) in partnership with SCaLE. The classes will give SCaLE attendees a more intense and personal learning experience on Friday, February 20th.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We are offering four half-day classes for system administrators of all skill and experience levels. The SCaLE University Pass includes a full day of training (two classes of your choice) and full access to all three days of SCaLE. To register, select the "SCALE 7x Full Access Pass" and then the "SCALE University Pass" which will include a $60 discount on your total charge.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Morning classes</span></b><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">9:00 - 12:30</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>Introduction to Virtualized Storage Management</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Instructor: Jesse Trucks</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Disk storage is no longer as simple as plugging in some disks and partitioning the individual physical drives for different mount</span><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> points. These days we need mount points larger than our disks, we use SAN and NAS storage that presents arbitrary drive sizes to the Operating System. We use an extra layer of management on our machines to logically manage the storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> This course will discuss how virtualized storage operates on a fundamental and technical level.  Real examples using storage<br />management packages available on many Linux and Unix systems, such the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) that is included in most Linux distributions and the Veritas Storage Foundation (VSF) suite's Veritas Volume Manager, will be used to illustrate the implementation of real world storage configurations.  Students are expected to bring questions of implementation for solving their storage needs, and participants can expect to utilize their new-found knowledge immediately upon returning to the office.</span></p>
<p><b>Internal documentation for SysAdmins</b><br />Instructor: Chris St. Pierre</p>
<p>This half-day class, dealing entirely with internal documentation -- i.e., documentation written for sysadmins, by sysadmins -- is designed as an introduction to the field for people who are not documenting, or documenting minimally, maybe with something like Word.<br /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The class begins with a theoretically grounding in the hierarchy of needs upon which good documentation systems are built.  From theory we move into practice, with a whirlwind discussion of wiki software, tips for getting other team members to write documentation and avoiding (or harnessing!) politics to get documentation written, and suggestions for where to start when you're staring at your big blank wiki.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Real-life examples of bad documentation -- some funny, some terrifying -- are used throughout the class to illustrate the topics and ideas taught.<br /><b><br />Afternoon Classes</b><br />1:30 - 5:00</span></p>
<p><b>Disaster Recovery: Will you survive?</b><br />Instructor: Jesse Trucks</p>
<p>Every IT operation eventually faces a disaster on some scale.  Despite most disaster based damage being avoidable, the result is usually catastrophic in some way or another. This class teaches how to mitigate risk of disaster through a variety of methods by covering Disaster Recovery (DR) as a discipline and the low level mechanics of evaluating risks and developing mitigation or reactive disaster recovery plans as part of business continuity planning. All system administrators, regardless of the size or scope of their operation, will benefit from the more in depth understanding of DR obtained through this class.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br />Students can expect to gain the skills and knowledge that allows them to implement immediate improvements to the disaster readiness of their own operations back at the office.  <br /><b><br />Saving the World with Fedora Directory Server</b><br />Instructor: Chris St. Pierre</span></p>
<p>Fedora Directory Server is a high performance, feature rich, enterprise-class LDAP server that also happens to be free.  An LDAP service can help you centralize authentication and authorization, widely distribute account information, and even integrate with Windows through Samba or Active Directory -- in effect, it can save your world from countless horrors.<br /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">This tutorial will introduce students to the wonders and joys of running LDAP, specifically through the magic of Fedora DS.  We'll<br />cover LDAP basics, setting up Fedora DS, and the Fedora DS graphical console, one of its most attractive features.  More advanced topics will include backups and restores, configuring SSL and TLS, multimaster replication, using and creating LDAP schemas, and the configuration tree in depth.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Much of this class will also be applicable to Sun Directory Server, CentOS Directory Server, and Redhat Directory Server, which are all based on the same codebase as Fedora DS. </span></p>
